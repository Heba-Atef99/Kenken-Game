Our project is a software that can solve Kenken game with any board size using backtracking, backtracking with forward checking, or backtracking with arc consistency.
</div>  

The goal of this project is to create a software that solves the KENKEN puzzle. This is a constrain satisfaction problem (CSP), and we implement and analyze the performance of the three algorithms of CSP:  
  1. Backtracking 
  2. Backtracking with forward checking 
  3. Backtracking with arc consistency

## GUI Manual
1. This is the front window in which the user specifies the board size as a single number and the algorithm used to solve the board.
